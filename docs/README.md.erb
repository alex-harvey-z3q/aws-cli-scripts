# AWS helpers

My collection of AWS helper scripts. These are scripts
that I have written over the years that I find frequently useful.

## Install

Run the installer:

```text
▶ make install
```

<%- Dir.glob("*sh").delete_if {|x| x =~ /install.sh/}.each do |file_name| -%>
## <%= file_name %>

<%# Uses the 3rd line of the script as the doc_string. -%>
<%= open(file_name).each_line.take(3).last.gsub(/^# /, "") -%>

```text
▶ <%= file_name %> -h
<%= %x{bash #{file_name} -h} -%>
```

<%- end -%>
## spacing.awk

An AWK script that can reset spacing in a CloudFormation YAML template in a visually appealing way.

```text
▶ spacing.awk YAML_FILE > temp ; mv temp TAML_FILE
```
